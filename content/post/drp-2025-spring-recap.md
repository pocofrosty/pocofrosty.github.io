I wanted to recap my sixth and final semester as part of UPenn's Directed Reading Program. During the semester, the general goal was to learn about Mapping Class Groups, a nice tool from geometric topology. Similar to algebraic topology, mapping class groups involve assigning certain algebraic structures (groups) to topological spaces, generating an invariant of the space. A central theme of problems in topology is distinguishing topological spaces apart. In a point-set topology class, we learn some topological properties that do so. For example, properties preserved under continuous mappings, such as compactness or being simply-connected, are fundamentally studying the structure of the open sets of a space. 

Spaces in mathematics is actually not a well-defined term. Informally, it refers to some sort of set equipped with a structure. For example, topological spaces capture general notions of points being "near" or "far" away. A more rigid notion of spaces might be **metric spaces**, which come equipped with a prescribed
