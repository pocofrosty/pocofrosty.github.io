I wanted to recap my 6th final semester as part of UPenn's Directed Reading Program. During the semester, the general goal was to learn about Mapping Class Groups, a nice tool from geometric topology. Similar to algebraic topology, mapping class groups involve assigning certain algebraic structures (groups) to topological spaces, generating an invariant of the space. Given two homeomorphic spaces, we hope that the associated mapping class groups are the same.
