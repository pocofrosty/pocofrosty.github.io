# About Darren Zheng

Hello! I'm Darren Zheng, a recent graduate from the University of Pennsylvania (2025), where I earned a B.A. in Mathematics and statistics minor. My primary mathematical interests are in low-dimensional topology, functional analysis and geometric measure theory. [^1]

## Background

Hello, welcome to my blog! I hope to be able to write regularly, so long as life doesn't get too busy. On this website, you will mostly find more academic, technical discussion about problems and topics I find interesting. The purpose of this site is to help motivate me to write down my thoughts more often. Posts will mainly focus on mathematics, but dependent on my motivation, may include a collection of programming, computer science, physics, finance, and general puzzling. Inevitably, my subjective opinions may seep into my writing, but I'll aim to keep it to a minimum. As time progresses, I hope to be able to strike the right balance. During my undergraduate studies, I mainly focused on low-dimensional topology, geometry, and functional analysis, but encountered a wide variety of disciplines throughout my education, thanks to my peers and professors.
